## JWT Implementation
JWT ( JSON WEB TOKEN) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. For more information and documentation for this service, visit (jwt.io)[https://jwt.io/]

# JWT Usage for the ecommerce gui
The user should be verified when he/she logs in when they want to make changes or updates using different routes.

# JWT Implementation
setup a utility folder in your app server. Create a auth.js file where you will have to get the environment variables passed in to this file by adding the .env file. Also, it is require to bring in the .json
